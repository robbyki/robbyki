## What am I up to?
- I'm currently working at IBM building application level tooling, build environments and ETL libraries for data engineering teams using scala, sbt and spark. 

## What do I find myself day-dreaming about?
  - wondering what I enjoy more -- writing or selling the solutions to complex problems
  - what is programming going to look like in 100 years from now?
  - finding the time to read more fiction (especially all of the incredible sci-fi I still have not read)
  - finding excuses to use my hand tools to build and fix things (or maybe break things in order to then fix them again)
  - writing optimal algorithms and data structures for solving problems
  - learning to write elegant and idiomatic solutions in scala and functional programming
  - being mesmerized when I come across beautifully constructed composable programs based on zio

## Two Industries I'm most excited to see (or help with) continued disruption:
  1. Education
  2. Health & Fitness
