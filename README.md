### *What am I up to?*
* Programming in Go, tweaking my [dotfiles](https://github.com/robbyki/dotfiles) and everything Linux, Kubernetes and Containers.

### *:grin: What I am most proud of:*
* My wife having the bravery to leave a big tech company in order to grow a team at a startup.

### *:tv: TV show that has had the most impact on my life:*
* I'm pretty sure by most psychological measures that the cast of Star Trek TNG has raised
  me. The awesome dynamic between Geordi and Data when they were collaborating
  and trying to come up with solutions to problems!!! Best thing ever.

### *:thinking: What I tend to find myself day-dreaming about:*
* "When do babies start sleeping through the night?"
* "Why are pavers so expensive for driveways?"
* "Do I completely hate programming or do I love it more than anything else?" (I have a feeling that question is common one among people who have devoted their careers to code.)
