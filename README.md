### *What am I up to?*
* I'm currently working at IBM building application-level tooling, build environments and ETL
  libraries for data engineering teams using scala, sbt and spark. 

### *:grin: What I am most proud of:*
* Becoming a software developer through obsessive and expensive autodidacticism
  * I tend to be get varying types of reactions to the idea that I don't have a traditional computer science degree. I
    suppose, in general, people tend to be impressed by the notion of being self-taught but I always feel the need to
    qualify and put into context the reality of what exactly it means to be an STP (self-taught programmer) -- Yes I
    just made up that acronym because I love acronyms. Firstly, I am not a programming prodigy by a long shot and
    although I have always had a passion for scientific oriented pursuits, it wasn't until much later in my career that
    I realized how much I enjoy building useful things using letters and symbols much less being able to make a living
    out of it. More importantly though, I discovered my joy with building things as a technical account manager at Yahoo
    where I had a blast from creating custom solutions using open source tools and then seeing the end-user reactions. I have always been the kind of person who has felt the need to fully grasp and understand the "whole"
    and creating solutions for clients without having a much more intimate relationship with the underlying components
    of something just always felt very wrong to me and also greatly hindered my ability to cultivate trust and
    credibility the way *I* wanted to cultivate trust and credibility. Which is why I wanted more of it; I wanted more
    of the feeling I would get whenever I fully and intricately understood the esoteric and then making that tangible
    and actionable for others was intoxicating to me. Having said that, being an STP IMHO, is an extremely costly
    endeavor I decided to pursue so I always have to calibrate any pre-conceived notions for how it all happened. Like I
    said, maybe some people can see the value in building "grit" and exercising the discipline required for learning
    programming on your own time, throughout every single weekend and putting myself into bed at barely 8pm so that I
    could wake at 4am and tap into my personal optimal circadiun rhythms but a part of me has always wished instead that
    I was more of an arrogant programming prodigy instead and I'm guessing that is not an uncommon thought among those
    who have had to endure hardship for a goal; perhaps you could also cogently argue that there are benefits and
    negatives to both scenarios, who knows. My bottom line explanation to those who express any degree of surprise from
    being a self-taught programmer is that it has required levels of commitment and focus and dedication I had
    cultivated as a youth playing competitive sports so even though it felt familiar to me, the sacrifice and the cost
    incurred does not change. Ultimately, I understand precisely at a remarkable and sobering level of detail what is
    required of *me* for accomplishing a particular goal or task. On the other hand, being a self-taught programmer has
    always made sure that I remain humble and compassionate about others when it comes to reaching a goal or trying to
    gain expertise in anything and that is something I am unquestionably grateful of.
* Not having a "job" in more than 15 years and counting myself among the 13%<sup>**</sup> globally who DO NOT consider
  the actual work they do a painfully loathsome never-ending nightmare. A statistic everyone in a leadership or
  management position should find alarming and unsettling. Based on my personal experiences at various organizations and
  cultures, I've concluded that creating an environment cultivating independence, decentralized decision making, joy,
  purpose and profitability is a highly difficult and complex challenge. I am so inspired by stories of people and
  organizations putting into practice difficult and selfless and compassionate measures to combat joyless work.
* Mentoring and having the opportunity to work with brilliant people and being able to convey my passion for technology
  to other developers who have then expressed to me how much darn fun they are having (most rewarding thing ever).

### *:tv: TV show that has had the most impact on my life:*
* I'm pretty sure by most psychological measures, the Star Trek TNG characters have literally raised
  me and have shaped a major part of my psyche. Geordi La Forge is hands down the coolest engineer
  in the history of humanity and probably the reason I even went into technology. On a side note and
  although I'm a big fan of parodies, IMHO the consistent caricaturization of engineers by hollywood
  is a toxic danger to how programmers are perceived by youth (ie. yes to portrayal of Commander
  Laforge, no to portrayal of Sheldon)

### *:thinking: What I tend to find myself day-dreaming about:*
* wondering what I enjoy more -- writing or selling solutions to complex problems
* what is programming going to look like 100 years from now?
* finding the time to read more fiction (especially all of the incredible sci-fi I still have not read)
* looking for excuses to build and fix things around the house (or maybe break things in order to then fix them again)
* writing optimal algorithms and data structures for solving problems
* learning to write elegant and idiomatic solutions in scala and functional programming
* being mesmerized when I come across beautifully constructed composable programs based on zio

### *:mortar_board: :weight_lifting_woman: Industries I'm most excited to see (or help with) continued disruption:*
1. Education
2. Health & Fitness

### *:disappointed: Cultural tragedies I plan to do my part as a new father to improve (92% of Devs are male...What??!!):*
* Women in STEM
* Ageism in Tech
