### *What am I up to?*
* Tweaking my [dotfiles](https://github.com/robbyki/dotfiles) and everything neovim, kubernetes, containers and cloud native developments.
* Builder, architect and open source tooling advocate at IBM working on prototypes and
  demos of cloud native deployments, frameworks and application build
  environments.

### *:grin: What I am most proud of:*
* Becoming a programmer through tenacious and very socially costly autodidacticism
* Not having a "job" in more than 15 years. 

### *:tv: TV show that has had the most impact on my life:*
* I'm pretty sure by most psychological measures, Star Trek TNG has co-raised
  me. The awesome dynamic between Geordi La Forge and Data when they were collaborating
  and trying to come up with solutions to problems is something that had a very
  inspirational impact on me.

* Finding the time to read more

### *:disappointed: Cultural tragedies I plan to do my part as a new father to improve (92% of Devs are male...What??!!):*
* Women in STEM
* Ageism in Tech

### :book: *Some of my favorite books:*
* Deep Work -- Cal Newport
* Walking -- Henry David Thoreau
* Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution -- Steven Levy
* Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions -- Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths
