## What am I up to?
- I'm currently working at IBM building application level tooling, build environments and ETL libraries for data engineering teams using scala and sbt and spark. 

## What do I find myself day-dreaming about?
  - wondering what I enjoy more -- writing or selling software solutions
  - computer science fundamentals
  - finding the time to read more fiction
  - finding excuses to use my hand tools to build and fix things (or maybe break things in order to put them back together again)
  - writing optimal algorithms and data structures for solving problems
  - scala and functional programming
  - being mesmerized when I come across beautifully constructed composable programs based on zio
