### *What am I up to?*
* I'm currently working at IBM building application-level tooling, build environments and ETL
  libraries for data engineering teams using scala, sbt and spark. 

### *What I am most proud of:*
* Not having a "job" in more than 15 years and being among the ~30% who DO NOT consider work they do
  a painfully loathsome never-ending nightmare. A statistic everyone in a leadership or management
  position should find alarming and unsettling. Based on my personal experiences at various
  organizations and cultures, I've concluded that creating an environment cultivating joy, purpose
  and profitability is a highly difficult and complex challenge. I am so inspired by stories of
  people and organizations putting into practice difficult and selfless and compassionate measures
  to combat joyless work.
* Surviving the first 2 years of parenting (this would obviously also imply that I've managed to
  keep my daughter alive as well)

### *TV show that has had the most impact on my life:*
* I'm pretty sure by most psychological measures, the Star Trek TNG characters have literally raised
  me and have shaped a major part of my psyche. Geordi La Forge is hands down the coolest engineer
  in the history of humanity and probably the reason I even went into technology. (FYI to the
  producers of the Bing Bang Theory...I'm a big fan of parodies but your inaccurate consistent portrayal of
  engineers is a toxic danger to how programmers are perceived by youth)

### *What I tend to find myself day-dreaming about?:*
* wondering what I enjoy more -- writing or selling solutions to complex problems
* what is programming going to look like 100 years from now?
* finding the time to read more fiction (especially all of the incredible sci-fi I still have not read)
* finding excuses to use my hand tools to build and fix things (or maybe break things in order to then fix them again)
* writing optimal algorithms and data structures for solving problems
* learning to write elegant and idiomatic solutions in scala and functional programming
* being mesmerized when I come across beautifully constructed composable programs based on zio

### *Industries I'm most excited to see (or help with) continued disruption:*
1. Higher Education
2. Health & Fitness

### *Cultural tragedies I plan to do my part as a new father to improve (92% of Devs are male...What??!!):*
* Women in STEM
* Ageism in Tech

### *Some of my favorite books:*
* Deep Work -- Cal Newport
* Walking -- Henry David Thoreau
* Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution -- Steven Levy
* Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions -- Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths
* The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck & Everything Is F*cked -- Mark Manson
